# ATOL drivers installer
This script is intended to install or remove the ATOL KKM software packages on Debian and Ubuntu Linux operating systems.

It provides the user with a menu for choosing actions: installing a package for the AMD64 or i386 architecture, deleting a package for one of these architectures, or exiting the program.

The script uses functions to install and remove packages, and checks for package files before performing operations.

The launch is performed via <code>chmod +x install_atol.sh</code> and <code>./install_atol.sh</code> commands. Further launch only via <code>./install_atol.sh</code>. The installation uses sudo.
